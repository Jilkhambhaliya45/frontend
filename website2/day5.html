                    Depiction: Devi Skandamata is often depicted as a radiant goddess seated on a lotus with a young child on her lap. She is the mother of Lord Kartikeya (Skanda or Murugan), who is considered the commander-in-chief of the celestial armies and the god of war and valor. Devi Skandamata's peaceful and nurturing form is in stark contrast to her son's fierce and warrior-like nature.

                    Four Arms: She is usually depicted with four arms, two of which hold lotus flowers, while the other two are in the Varada Mudra (granting boons) and Abhaya Mudra (assuring fearlessness) positions. These gestures symbolize her blessings and protection for her devotees.
                    
                    Significance: Devi Skandamata is a symbol of motherly love, care, and maternal instincts. Her worship emphasizes the importance of motherhood and the bond between a mother and her child. It also signifies the idea that true spirituality lies in recognizing the divine presence in all forms of life.
