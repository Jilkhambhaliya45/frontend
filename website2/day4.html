            Creator of the Universe: Devi Kushmanda is believed to be the creator of the universe. She is often depicted as seated on a lion, symbolizing courage and strength, and she is seen holding a pot or kalasha filled with divine nectar (amrita) and a rosary. It is believed that her smile and radiance dispelled the darkness in the universe and gave birth to the creation of the cosmos.

Iconography: Devi Kushmanda is usually depicted with eight or ten arms, each holding different objects or symbols, including a discus, mace, bow, arrow, lotus, chakra (wheel), and a conch shell. Her glowing aura and effulgent appearance symbolize her role as the source of cosmic energy and light.

Worship during Navaratri: Devotees worship Devi Kushmanda on the fourth day of Navaratri, which is dedicated to her. It is believed that by worshiping her, one can obtain her blessings for good health, courage, and spiritual well-being.
