                Granting of Siddhis: Devi Siddhidatri is revered as the goddess who bestows siddhis or mystical powers and blessings upon her devotees. These siddhis may include spiritual enlightenment, psychic abilities, material prosperity, and more. Her devotees seek her blessings for spiritual growth and to overcome obstacles in their lives.

                Iconography: She is often depicted seated on a lotus flower or a lion, symbolizing purity and strength. She has four arms, which carry a mace (gada), a lotus flower (kamandalu), a chakra (discus), and a conch shell (shankha). These symbols represent various aspects of her divine powers and influence.
                
                Worship during Navaratri: Devotees worship Devi Siddhidatri on the ninth day of Navaratri, known as Navami. This day marks the culmination of the nine-day festival, and it is believed that by invoking her blessings, one can attain spiritual perfection and achieve success in their endeavors.
