                Origin of the Name: Devi Katyayani's name is derived from her origin story. According to Hindu mythology, she was born as the daughter of Rishi Katyayana, an ancient sage. Hence, she is called "Katyayani" to signify her lineage.

                Appearance: Devi Katyayani is often depicted as a fierce and powerful goddess. She is typically portrayed as having four arms and riding a lion. She is adorned with various weapons in her hands, including a sword and a lotus, symbolizing her warrior nature and divine grace.
                
                Destroyer of Evil: Devi Katyayani is believed to have manifested to defeat the demon Mahishasura, a powerful buffalo-headed demon who terrorized the world. Her fierce form is associated with her battle against evil forces and her determination to restore righteousness.
