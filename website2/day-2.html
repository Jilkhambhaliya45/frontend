                Devi Brahmacharini is the second form of the Navadurga, the nine forms of the Hindu goddess Durga1. The term “Brahmacharini” in Sanskrit means a devoted female student who lives in an Ashrama with her Guru along with other students1. She is worshipped on the second day of Navaratri, the nine divine nights of Navadurga1.

The goddess Brahmacharini is an aspect of Parvati and wears white clothes, holding a japamala (rosary) in her right hand and a kamandalu (water pot) in her left1. The word “brahmacharini” stems from two Sanskrit roots: “Brahma”, which means “the one self-existent Spirit, the Absolute Reality, Universal Self, Personal God, the sacred knowledge”, and “charini”, which means "occupation with, engaging, proceeding, behaviour, conduct, to follow, moving in, going after"1.
According to legend, maiden Parvati resolves to marry Shiva. Despite discouragement from her parents, she remains steadfast and performs a penance for about 5000 years1. During this time, she lives in mountains like Shiva and engages in the same activities he does, such as asceticism, yogin and tapas; it is this aspect of Parvati that is deemed to be that of goddess Brahmacharini1.
