                Fierce Appearance: Devi Kalratri is depicted with a terrifying and fierce appearance. She is often portrayed with disheveled hair, a dark complexion, and a menacing expression. Her eyes are red, and she has a third eye on her forehead, symbolizing her divine perception and knowledge.

                Iconography: She is typically shown riding a donkey, holding a sword in one hand and a noose in the other. Her four hands represent the four directions, symbolizing her all-pervading presence and control over the universe. In some depictions, she is shown with flames emanating from her nostrils, signifying her destructive power.
                
                Destructive Aspect: Devi Kalratri is the destroyer of ignorance and negativity. She is believed to annihilate evil forces, demons, and darkness. Her fierce form represents the destructive aspect of time and the ultimate truth that everything in the material world is impermanent.
