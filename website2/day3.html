                Devi Chandraghanta is a Hindu goddess and a form of Goddess Parvati after she is married to Lord Shiva⁴. The name Chandraghanta is a combination of two words, Chandra meaning moon and ghanta meaning bell⁴. She is depicted with a half-moon on her forehead that looks like a bell, hence the name¹.

She is the third navadurga aspect of goddess Mahadevi, worshipped on the third day of Navaratri (the nine divine nights of Navadurga)¹. Her third eye is always open, signifying her perpetual readiness for battle against evil¹.

She is depicted with ten hands. Goddess Chandraghanta carries Trishul, Gada, Sword and Kamandal in her four left hands and keeps the fifth left hand in Varada Mudra. She carries lotus flower, Arrow, Dhanush and Japa Mala in her four right hands and keeps the fifth right hand in Abhaya Mudra².

This form of Goddess Parvati is peaceful and for the welfare of her devotees. In this form, Goddess Chandraghanta is ready for the war with all her weapons. It is believed that the sound of the moon-bell on her forehead expels all types of spirits away from her devotees².
